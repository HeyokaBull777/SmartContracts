### Smart Contracts 

#Using Remix, a file was created called 'Puppercoin.sol
Using Remix, create a file called `PupperCoin.sol` and create a standard `ERC20Mintable` token. Since you're already an expert at this, you can simply use this [starter code](../Starter-Code/PupperCoin.sol).

Create a new contract named `PupperCoinCrowdsale.sol`, and prepare it like a standard crowdsale.
