### Smart Contracts 

# Using the application Remix, a smart contract was deployed. 

#Using Remix, a file was created called 'Puppercoin.sol.'A standard 'ERC20Mintable' token was created. A new contract was written to prepare a standard crowdsale named 'PupperCoinCrowdsale.sol.'

#The contract was designed to simply use a standard 'ERC20Mintable' and 'ERC20Detailed' contract, hardcoding '18' as the decimals parameter, and leaving the 'initial_supply' parameter alone.
